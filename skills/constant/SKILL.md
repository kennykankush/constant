description: "Carry a conversation between agent CLIs (Codex, Claude Code, OpenCode; Gemini as a source) with Constant. Use when the user asks to move, hand off, fork, or continue this thread (or another one) in a different agent CLI, to find or read back an earlier carried conversation, or mentions Constant by name. Do not use for running a second agent in parallel or for general session search unrelated to carrying."

# Constant

Constant carries one conversation between agent CLIs. It reads a runtime's
local session, strips it to the conversation, redacts secrets, records a
snapshot, and writes a session the target runtime can resume natively. The
target then continues the thread with the history in its own context.

Supported targets: `codex`, `claude`, `opencode`. Gemini sessions can be
carried from, not into.

## Learn the installed CLI

The installed binary is the authority for syntax. Check it first:

```bash
constant --version
constant doctor --json      # installed runtimes, versions, and whether each is validated
```

`constant --help` prints the full command reference. `constant integration`
shows which runtimes have this guide installed as a skill.

Use `--json` (or `--plain`) on every read command. Several commands open an
interactive picker or explorer when they run in a terminal with no arguments
(`constant resume`, `constant sessions`, `constant trail`). Never run
`constant host` or `constant resume` from an agent: they take over the
terminal with a live runtime.

## Carry this conversation to another runtime

Name your own session explicitly instead of relying on "newest in this
folder":

| You are running in | Your session id |
| --- | --- |
| Claude Code | `$CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID` |
| Codex | `$CODEX_THREAD_ID` |
| other | `constant sessions --from <runtime> --json`, newest `id` for this `cwd` |

Preview, then carry:

```bash
constant carry --session "$CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID" --to codex --dry-run --json
constant carry --session "$CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID" --to codex --json
```

The JSON result includes:

- `id`: the target runtime's session id
- `resume`: the exact command that resumes it (for example `codex resume <id>`)
- `handle`: the conversation's stable name, such as `cobalt-37`
- `receipt`: what was kept, dropped, and redacted (`turns`, `tools`,
  `dropped_tools`, `dropped_scaffold`, `dropped_reasoning`, `redactions`)

Give the user the `resume` command and the receipt. Carrying does not move
the user's terminal; the user, or a terminal multiplexer they asked you to
drive, runs the `resume` command.

Your current turn is still being written while you run the carry, so the
carried copy ends at the last completed turn. Say so if it matters.

Options:

- `--with-tools`: also carry tool calls and their results (redacted and size
  capped). Without it, only the conversation text carries.
- `--new`: fork a separate continuation instead of refreshing the existing
  target session for this conversation.
- `--render paged`: for very long threads, carry a compact layout (summary
  card, index, recent turns verbatim). Older turns stay readable with
  `constant recall`.

Carrying again to the same target refreshes that target session in place.
The source session is never modified.

## Find conversations

```bash
constant sessions --json               # carryable sessions for this folder, newest first
constant sessions --all --json         # every runtime store
constant sessions auth --json          # filter by name or id
constant ps --json                     # agent sessions running right now, with resume commands
constant route --json                  # carry lineage (which session came from which)
```

## Read history back

```bash
constant recall cobalt-37              # a carried conversation's filed turns, by handle
constant recall cobalt-37 ch04 12      # one turn, verbatim
constant recall cobalt-37 ch04 3-9     # a range
constant export --session <id> --out thread.json   # distilled, redacted conversation as JSON
```

`recall` and `export` are read-only.

## Rules

- Carry only when the user asks for it. A carry writes a new session into
  the target runtime's store (`~/.codex`, `~/.claude`, or OpenCode through
  its own import command).
- Do not delete sessions, snapshots, or `~/.constant`. Constant never
  overwrites an original session; keep it that way.
- Never run the `gemini` binary to inspect sessions. Carry gemini sessions
  with `constant carry --session <path> --to <target>` instead.
- Redaction covers common secrets (API keys, tokens, private keys, auth
  headers, email addresses), not everything. Do not carry a thread into a
  runtime the user would not want reading it.
- If `doctor` shows a runtime version that is not validated, tell the user
  before carrying into it.
